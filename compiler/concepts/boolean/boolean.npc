};

{.
  we have Boolean type that is compatible with other languages
  where value 0 means False, value 1 means True,
  but our Boolean has special meaning for value -1 which means Error
  
  for compatibility reasons when calling third party libraries which might return -1 as Boolean value
  in that case the value is absoluted (ABS) to positive number
.}
